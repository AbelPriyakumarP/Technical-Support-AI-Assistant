 1 Overview
 This knowledge base provides solutions to common software and hardware issues en
countered by users. It is designed for use in a Corrective Retrieval-Augmented Gen
eration (C-RAG) system to retrieve accurate, up-to-date technical support information,
 detect errors or outdated solutions, and correct responses for reliability.
 2 SoftwareTroubleshooting
 2.1 Application Crash on Windows
 Issue: An application crashes immediately after launch on Windows 10 or 11.
 Symptoms: Error message (e.g., ”Application has stopped working”), or the application
 closes without warning.
 Solution:
 • Restart the application and ensure it is updated to the latest version. Check the ven
dor’s website for updates (e.g., https://www.vendor.com/support).
 • Update Windows to the latest version via Settings > Windows Update.
 • Runtheapplication as an administrator (right-click the app icon > Run as administra
tor).
 • Check for conflicting software (e.g., antivirus). Temporarily disable third-party an
tivirus and retry.
 • Reinstall the application if the issue persists.

 2.2 SlowInternet Connection
 Issue: Internet speed is slower than expected or pages fail to load.
 Symptoms: Bufferingduring streaming, slow downloads, or high ping in online games.
 Solution:
 • Test internet speed using a tool like Ookla Speedtest (https://www.speedtest.net).
 • Restart your router/modem by unplugging it for 30 seconds.
 • Ensure no background applications are consuming bandwidth (e.g., cloud backups,
 updates). Check Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) on Windows or Activity Monitor on
 macOS.

 2.4 BlueScreen of Death (BSOD) onWindows
 Issue: Windows displays a blue screen with an error message and restarts.
 Symptoms: Errorcodeslike”CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED”or”IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL”.
 Solution:
 • Note the error code displayed on the blue screen.
 • Boot into Safe Mode (press F8 during startup) to troubleshoot.
 • Update all drivers via Device Manager or the manufacturer’s website (e.g., https:

 3.1 ComputerWon’tPowerOn
 Issue: Desktop or laptop does not turn on when the power button is pressed.
 Symptoms: Nolights, no fan noise, or a blank screen.
 Solution:
 • Verify the power cable is securely connected and the outlet is functional.
 • For laptops, ensure the battery is charged or connect to a power adapter.
 • Perform a hard reset by holding the power button for 20 seconds (unplug all periph
erals first).
 • Check for hardware issues (e.g., loose RAM, disconnected cables) if comfortable open
ing the device.
 • Contact the manufacturer or a certified technician if unresolved.
